My dotfiles and scripts
=======================

The dotfiles are not particularly exotic.
What you might find partly useful are the scripts.

Scripts in ~/bin
================
- buddyinfo-mon
    Interactive /proc/buddyinfo monitoring tool.
    Update every <n> seconds or 1s if unspecified.
  Usage
    $ buddyinfo-mon <n>
    --
    j k    line down/up
    space  page down
    g G    top/bottom
    q      quit
  Dependencies
    * python (3.7+)

- cgb
    Print the name of the current git branch in the format: "($branch) "
    or nothing if not inside a git repository. It is meant to be used
    inside of PROMPT_COMMAND or PS1. Compared to other solutions it is
    FAST - ~650 bytes of machine code that glues together a few system
    calls packed into an <4K executable for any x86-64 Linux - your shell
    prompt will never feel sluggish again.
  Usage
    In ~/.bashrc PROMPT_COMMAND:
      PROMPT_COMMAND+=(cgb)
    In ~/.bashrc PS1:
      PS1="\$(cgb)[\u \w]\n$ "
  Crude perf benchmarks
    Context: In the root of a git repository.
    Setup: # perf stat -e cycles,instructions -r 100 "$@"
      __git_ps1                 (~ 11 000 000 instructions)
      git branch --show-current (~  2 780 000 instructions)
      cgb                       (~     85 000 instructions)
  Build dependencies
    * gcc/clang
  Installation
    $ PROGS=cgb ~/bin/src/install.sh

- deduplicate-bash-history
    Remove duplicates from the ~/.bash_history file.
    Only the most recently used commands are kept.
  Dependencies
    * python (3.8+)

- dirg
    Group file paths by the directories they belong to.  File paths
    should be newline delimited and provided as standard input.
  Options
    a  sort alphabetically
    c  show file count per directory
    h  display help and exit
  Usage
    $ <cmd> | dirg [a] [c] [h]
    $ locate path | dirg c
    $ find . -type f | dirg ac
  Alternatives
    If a more readable tree output is preferred
    the tree(1) utility should be used.
