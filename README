My dotfiles and scripts
=======================

The dotfiles are not particularly exotic.
What you might find partly useful are the scripts.

Some scripts may be tagged:

  `see source`  these scripts may contain hard-coded values or exhibit
                undesirable behavior; you should certainly read and understand
                their source code before executing them.

  `specific`    these scripts may require some specific hardware configuration
                in order to work correctly or to be by any means useful.

  `wayland`     these scripts work only in the presence of the Wayland
                compositor.

Scripts in ~/bin listed alphabetically
======================================

- _installgofonts (see source)
    Install the best fonts to the ~/.local/share/fonts/Go
    directory and refresh the font cache.
  Dependencies
    * dash (shell)
    * git, fc-cache

- brightness (see source, specific)
    Set backlight brightness to <n> * STEP or query the current
    backlight brightness value if <n> is unspecified.
  Usage
    $ brightness <n>
  Dependencies
    * dash (shell)
    * python (3.7+)

- buddyinfo-mon
    Interactive /proc/buddyinfo monitoring tool.
    Update every <n> seconds or 1s if unspecified.
  Usage
    $ buddyinfo-mon [<n>]
    --
    j k    line down/up
    space  page down
    g G    top/bottom
    q      quit
  Dependencies
    * python (3.7+)

- cgb
    Print the name of the current git branch in the format: "($branch) "
    or nothing if not inside a git repository. It is meant to be used
    inside of PROMPT_COMMAND or PS1. Compared to other solutions it is
    FAST - ~650 bytes of machine code that glues together a few system
    calls packed into a <4K executable for any x86-64 Linux - your shell
    prompt will never feel sluggish again.
  Usage
    In ~/.bashrc PROMPT_COMMAND:
      PROMPT_COMMAND+=(cgb)
    In ~/.bashrc PS1:
      PS1="\$(cgb)[\u \w]\n$ "
  Crude perf benchmarks
    Context: In the root of a git repository.
    Setup: # perf stat -e cycles,instructions -r 100 "$@"
      __git_ps1                 (~ 11 000 000 instructions)
      git branch --show-current (~  2 780 000 instructions)
